Research: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/debugging In VSCode I used the debugger tool to find out that the file that I made for practicing debugging was not working because it was not in a proper folder. I also learned that in VSCode, only syntax errors are reported for non-project files. The debugger tool also has the option of bringing you to a trouble shooting guide.
Reflect: I was working on a project in Java for my CPS-101 class. There was a constructor class that was supposed to read a text file line by line. Each line was split into substrings and feed into another constructor class to create an object instance and append the object to the array list, but the class would not return an array list object. I initially deleted the entire class and retyped hoping I simply made a syntax error. I tried a whole bunch of things that did not work but what finally did work was printing out each line while the method read through the array list, it worked so I figured out that the problem was not with the method reading through the text file but rather with the array list itself. I figured out that I forget to add the array list as a parameter to the constructor class. If I were to come across this problem with the skills I knew now, I would have tried commenting out the code rather than deleting it all.
